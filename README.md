ML project with NFL game data

Project Description:
This project predicts game outcomes based on team statistics (except final score) for a game.
Using this information, you can see which games had unexpected results. 

Future Work:
From these unexpected results, I can fine tune my model and parameters to be more accurate in predicting past and future games.
Then, I will compare my model's predictions versus game results and gambling odds to calculate expected value of the model.
